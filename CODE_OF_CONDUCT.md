Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this standard and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
